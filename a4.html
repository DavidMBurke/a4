    <h2>Proposition: The U.S. does not have culpability in the U.S. Climate Crisis. </h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="./a4_files/BadClimateArgument.jpg" alt="Graoh showing top ten contributers to greenhouse gas emission by region as a percent of total, and change in emission over last 10 years in each.">
				<figcaption>
					(Left) Top 10 regions contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. (Right) Yearly greenhouse gas emissions by each of these regions from 2013-2022.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The choice of using total emissions by region was meant to create the appearance that the contribution of the United States is relatively small on a global scale, thus arguing for a lack of culpability by the United States. On the deception scale I rate this as a -1.5, as it does provide information that is technically true without skewing the scales, but the point it makes does not hold up given external context on things like the relative populations of those regions, secondhand contribution by the U.S. through manufacturing overseas, capabilities and resources available to reduce impacts that are readily available and not being utilized, and many other important factors that are not covered with such a gross oversimplification. Beyond those deceptions, the core argument is purely whataboutism, as regardless of whether the U.S. is the largest contributer there is no question that it is contributing on an impactful scale.</li>
				<li>The decision not to include any reference or scale for the magnitude of emissions other than comparison to other countries was deliberate, with the intent of the user viewing the middle of the graph as an average or norm. If any information such as average percentage or average net production of emissions globally were provided, it would be clear that regardless of any larger contributers, the United States has an extremely large impact on global scales.</li>
				<li>Another deception was using Europe as an individual region while all other columns were nations. I rate this as -2, as it artificially allows the United States to be ranked third rather than second on global contribution. Many similar graphics of climate change contribution display the European Union rather than Europe as a whole even when mostly comparing nations, which can be argued for based on the common laws and policies enacted by the EU, but it ignores the vastly different contributions and national policies of the individual countries.</li>
				<li>Additionally, the choice of title for the graphs displayed extreme bias, with the intent of drawing in the reader and placing assumptions and predispositions in their mind. Calling U.S. climate culpability a 'myth' that was dispelled suggests both that the idea is disproven by this graphic and that the reader has been misled on the topic previously, none of which is objective information. For that reason this also has a -2 on the deception scale.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img style = "width: 60%" src="./a4_files/GoodClimateArgument.jpg" alt="Graph showing per-capita greenhouse gas emissions for the world's top 10 contributing regions.">
				<figcaption>
					Comparison of per-capita greenhouse gas emissions, measured in climate impact equivalency to tons of CO2.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This graphic is meant to directly counter the initially provided point by showing that, with populations taken into account, the U.S. has a much higher rate of greenhouse gas emissions per person. I rate this as a 1, because while it does provide valuable context to the data represented in the first argument, it exhibits a similar problem in that it leaves out key context, namely on those factors of a nation's climate impacts that are not directly related to population scale. While things like vehicle carbon emissions, power used for homes, etc. will scale with population, many impacts of climate change such as deforestation, drilling for resources, and infrastructure policy have an impact that is either not directly tied to population or that fall squarely in the control of the country's leadership and not individuals. A more detailed and balanced analysis would need to delve deeper into these considerations.</li>
				<li>The title is very clear on the information provided and expresses a conclusion that is objective and proven by the data given. For this reason I rate it as a 2.</li>
				<li>The decision to keep Europe as its own region is given a 1.5. It was not meant to mislead the reader, and the argument this graphic is making does not benefit from this, it is kept this way solely to provide a direct rebuttal to the previous arguments. This does still introduce the other problems that were mentioned with doing so in the previous graphic, however, and if a full data-driven response were to be made to the original argument this should be changed with an explanation of how the previously used representation of Europe was misleading.</li>
				<li>While it made sense to only include the top 10 contributers to greenhouse gas emissions in the very narrow context of this argument, it is misleading on its own. When looking at the top 10 contributers Americans do have the largest per-capita carbon footprint, but when comparing all nations there are many countries with much higher per-capita impact. Without representation of this information a reader is likely to come away from an article with the belief that the United States has the largest per-capita contribution in the world, so for that reason I give this decision a 1.</li>
				<li>Inclusion of the global per-capita greenhouse gas contribution provided a factual and easily visualizable baseline for the reader to contextualize the values they are seeing in the graphic. I give this design decision a 2.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		My intent in the design of my initial argument was to take a talking point that I have heard many times before (and which I entirely disagree with) and make a convincing case for it using the available data.
		Creating convincing visuals while knowingly excluding data was not itself difficult; the challenge was in preventing my deceptions from being too overt.
		I wished to create a case that could not be unravelled with a single easily-searched question, but ultimately I could not think of a way to accomplish this.
		However, it occured to me that this is always the case with deceptive uses of data. One can always identify deceptions, intentional or otherwise, by inquiring, questioning, and seeking deeper context and understanding.
		Ultimately, I opted for making an argument that seemed to show overwhelming support for my case, and a title which was meant to quickly drive the reader to the intended conclusion.
		While a reader could identify this deception very easily by noting the relative populations of the included regions, a simple and clear idea (however wrong or misleading it may be) is enough to have someone quickly internalize and go on to share an idea, which is exactly what makes powerful data visualizations both useful and dangerous.

	  	</br>
		My second argument was written with the intent of being a factual rebuttal to the first. What was surprising about this was that, in countering something which was loaded with artificial bias, I inadvertently introduced my own bias into the rebuttal. 
		Were I to do an objective data-driven analysis on countries' impact on climate change, I believe I would have thought to provide the contextual information I described as lacking in my design points.
		However, as my points were all driven by responses to the initial argument, in selecting data and making my case for the alternative viewpoint, I did not initially consider these things.
		I was able to identify this bias after-the-fact, but it made me very aware of how easy it is to overcompensate for bad data use against your case to the extent of doing the same for your case.
		It also showed me a challenge that comes with countering claims with data; it is much harder to make quickly digestable points when performing deeper and more honest analysis than it is to make quick, deceptive arguments.
		While many, myself included, find great interest in data explorations that dive deep to answer challenging questions, the people who are most susceptible to being influenced by misrepresented data are not as likely to be among those.
		The first graphic with its click-bait style title is much more likely to be passed around and internalized than the multi-graphic exposatory analysis that I believe is required to perform a fair and convincing comparison of different countries' global impacts on the Climate Crisis, which highlights the difficulty of combatting misinformation in the information age.
